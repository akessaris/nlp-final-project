##Problem Statement
Medical literature contains an abundance of useful information, but when it comes to classifying the exact data it holds, it can be overwhelming for any content management system. Thankfully, there are ways of grouping content under the standardized classification system known as the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). Using vector representations of clinical documents based on MeSH terms would allow for rapid, automatic, and standardized classification and tagging of other clinical documents.
